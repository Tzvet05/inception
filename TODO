Is this command really needed ??? Whats this directory ?
rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

To test :
If root privileges given to mariadb client in config file are not sufficient for privileges, add "chown -R mysql:mysql /run/mysqld" to give user & group privileges to the file (to store pid and socket files)

Notes :
- skip-networking = 0 is the default already

2) WordPress

3) NginX
