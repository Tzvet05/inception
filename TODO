MariaDB :
Choose between removing "chown -R mysql:mysql /run/mysqld" from the Dockerfile or replacing "user = root" by "user = mysql" in the configuration file
-> Probably better to use "user = mysql"

WordPress :
Make sure that the environment variables passed to WordPress through the environment section in the docker-compose file are not needed by the PHP child processes (otherwise set "clear_env = no" or add explicit environment variables injection in www.conf)
-> PHP child processes most likely don't need them

MISC :
Use a single shared Alpine package (in srcs/ or requirements/) (if possible)
rm .gitignore
rm TODO
